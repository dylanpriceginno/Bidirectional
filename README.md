# Bidirectional Flow Analysis
A PowerBI model to dipslay the difference in item flow between 2 sites. Aim was ot get this difference and evaluate it by region, then estimate the cost saving if we reduced the differece. I have select 4 pages from the 10 page report to display. I have removed any PID and I used dummy data.

Page 1 - Flow Map - Map to display each movement with a tool tip that displays the flow. Bar charts which display the sites with the most flow units.

Page 2 - Empty miles - Calculation slide which work souts the number of empty runs, miles and those used for container repatriation.

Page 3 - Route Breakdown - A breakdown of every single run and what it is made up of, allows for a deep dive of a run and to target it. Would allow manager to see their current metrics.

Page 3 - Opportunity Analysis - Using the calculated empty miles, add in the average costs to workout cost saving if we reduced empty miles.
